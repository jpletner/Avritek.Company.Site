		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.avritek.com/2016/04/21/hard-drive-shredding-san-diego/"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Is hard drive shredding necessary?</h2>
<p>Hard drive shredding  is a secure way to ensure that personal and customer data contained in hard drives is destroyed. Hard drives store their data on what are called &#8220;platters&#8221;. Hard drives shredding ensures that these platters are destroyed. After this, the risk of  information being recovered is almost nonexistent. Hard drive shredding is an approved way to destroy hard drives. It is endorsed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which is a United States government organization. Using a professional shredding device is the easiest way to ensure that a hard drive&#8217;s data is infeasible to recover. There are other ways to destroy data such as through approved sanitization and degaussing methods. However, many organizations require hard drive shredding.</p>
<h2>Will other destruction methods work, like drilling hard drives, or crushing them?</h2>
<p>Hard drive shredding is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of a data breach. From the <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf" target="_blank">NIST handbook on media sanitization</a>: &#8220;Bending, Cutting, and the use of some emergency procedures (such as using a firearm to shoot a hole through a storage device) may only damage the media as portions of the media may remain undamaged and therefore accessible&#8221; Because of this, hard drive shredding is recommended over these methods.</p>
<h2>How do I know my information has been destroyed after shredding?</h2>
<p>Choosing a certified vendor to perform hard drive shredding services is important. Unannounced audits such as those performed by the <a href="http://www.naidonline.org/nitl/en/certification.html" target="_blank">National Association of Information Destruction (NAID)</a> provide the guarantee that a vendor&#8217;s facility is secure and that their processes for hard drive shredding and destruction meet rigorous quality standards. Additionally, NAID certified vendors such as Avritek are required to provide serialized Certificates of Destruction upon completion of any hard drive shredding project.</p>
<h2>How do NAID AAA Certified vendors protect my data?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, NAID AAA Certified organizations help their clients meet their regulatory compliance obligations, including: HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley), PCI (Payment Card Industry Security Standards) and FACTA (Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act).</p>
<ul>
<li class="tb f129"><span class="tx">More than 1,000 operations on five continents are certified by NAID, including mobile, plant-based,</span><span class="tx">paper, and computer destruction services.

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="tb f129"><span class="tx">NAID certification is acknowledged by many accreditation programs, such as those offered by the</span><span class="tx">International Association of IT Asset Managers, the Institute of Certified Records Managers, and the R2 IT </span><span class="tx">asset recycling program certification offered by the Sustainable Electronic Recycling Institute (SERI)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="tb f129"><span class="tx f127">All NAID certified service providers are subject to regularly scheduled, onsite audits by trained, accredited </span><span class="tx f127">security professionals.

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="tb f129"><span class="tx">The program requires written policies and procedures for each company to ensure incident response </span><span class="tx">preparedness, employee training, and regulatory compliance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="tb f129"><span class="tx">Accredited auditors review employee background screening and training, compliance with written </span><span class="tx">procedures, access controls, operational security, destruction equipment, and confidentiality agreements. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in June of 2015 the Food and Drug Administration was part of a world wide effort to combat the online sale and distribution of potentially counterfeit and illegal medical products. The effort, called Operation Pangea VIII included 115 countries and resulted in over 2,400 websites being taken offline and the seizure of $81 million worth of potentially dangerous illegal medicines and medical devices worldwide.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Detecting counterfeit devices can be difficult, which is why some manufacturers are working to create authentication methods that will detect bad pieces of hardware.</span></p>
<p>For instance, Accutronics, a UK based battery and charger design, development and manufacturing company is developing new features in its smart batteries and chargers that can help fight counterfeit batteries and their negative impact on medical devices. In their new line of batteries and chargers, Accutronics is incorporating SHA-1 encryption, which will serve as a verification marker of authenticity when inserted into a compatible device. Innovations like this will increasingly be necessary to ensure that buyers of medical devices are receiving the genuine article.</p>
<p>Avritek frequently works with medical device manufacturers to ensure that recalled, or compromised devices are destroyed so that they pose no risk.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.avritek.com/2016/01/21/avritek-project-files-volume-1-technology-facility-closure/"><![CDATA[<h2>Asset Recovery and Hard Drive Shredding: A Common Need for Facilities Who are Closing Their Doors</h2>
<p>I thought that it was appropriate to start off the New Year of 2016 by going back to the beginning of 2015.  <a href="http://www.avritek.com">Avritek</a> does a lot of project-based work and the following illustrates how our expertise in IT asset disposition and hard drive shredding can help our clients during critical times likes office moves and facility closures.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in 2015 year we received a call from one of our vendor partners who worked at a large telecom company. He said that one of his clients was the VP of operations at a satellite communications company which was closing its San Diego operations, and that he had talked to him about our services. After the client expressed interest, we set up a short call to discuss the project. During the call I learned that the company had to vacate its building within two months and needed a number of our services including IT asset disposition, and data destruction / hard drive shredding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the usual IT equipment that we find in most tech companies, there was also a large amount of excess test equipment, telecom scrap, and cabling that had to be factored into the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because much of this equipment had significant value, we began the project by making a itemized inventory of this gear and providing an initial purchase quote which would be paid out after testing by our technicians. Each item was identified by make, model, and the room it was located in (server room, test lab, office etc).  </span></p>
<p>In addition to this equipment we provided a per pound payment quote on  the large amount of communications equipment scrap and cabling that was left in the facility.  Lastly, we provided our standard hard drive shredding and data destruction quotes for all of the hard drives and LTO tapes that our client required to be destroyed.</p>
<p>After the client accepted the initial quotes, we decided that a series of weekly IT asset disposition take-outs would be best for this particular project. Over the course of a month we consolidated and removed their materials, including the frequent swap-out of the large bins that we provided them to put miscellaneous equipment in. We have found that by providing these bins during the consolidation process, and by working with the client to design a process that works around their business, we are able to complete a project with minimal disruption to their operations.  When we received the equipment at our facility and tested all payable gear, we found that approximately 20% of the test equipment did not function properly. Payment for these items was amended as per our agreement with the client.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is common in these closures, mid-way through the project a few former employees began to  request if they could purchase some of the excess equipment. This can be a delicate scenario since some of these same people can actually be involved in the IT asset disposition process. However, we understand that not all requests can be made ahead of time, and we are usually happy to provide updated quotes which take these requests into account.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completed the take-out ahead of schedule, and provided the client with a check for the itemized payable equipment, and scrap value of the telecom and cable shortly thereafter. The hard drive and LTO tape shredding charges were simply deducted against this payment. At the conclusion of the project both the VP of Operations and CEO expressed how pleased they were with our team’s performance, which I always appreciate hearing.</span></p>
<p>2015 continued to be a great year. In fact, it was by far our most successful year as a company in terms of revenue and profitably, as well as continuing to learn and grow as an organization. Although we have just started 2016, this year is shaping up to be another great one and I look forward to sharing it with you through more Project File posts.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from security analysis firm Trend Micro has highlighted a new strain of POS systems  malware called BlackPOS. The malware seeks out POS systems within networks and uses the Gorynych/Diamond Fox botnet to exfiltrate stolen data. Trend Micro analysts found that the malware has already infiltrated small and medium-sized business networks around the globe, and continues to spread.</span></p>
<p>To launch the attacks, cybercriminals use penetration testing tools to gather information about their target networks. Then the criminals use another set of tools to penetrate these networks. The attack makes use of the Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) which can be used to exchange files with Microsoft. BITS typically used to download system updates.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To combat this threat, the researchers advise that network defense personnel beef up their password protection policies and log activities like port and vulnerability scanning, and brute-force attack attempts. Additionally, IT administrators should to keep current on known POS malware and make themselves aware of indicators of compromise lists that can help mitigate these threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, it’s crucial that companies keep accurate inventory of their hardware and software so that they can keep aging and unsupported assets out of their networks. The longer a device is around, the more time cybercriminals have to find and exploit hardware and software vulnerabilities. For instance, out of date Windows Embedded OS&#8217;s have recently </span><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/08/xp_embedded_atm_security_cutoff_panic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put thousands of ATMs at risk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of breach in the UK.</span></p>

<p>Point of care devices are transforming the medical industry by increasing the speed at which tests can be run, medical information can be accessed, and clinical decisions can be made. SSD storage has played a key role in this process. With low power consumption, fast access to data, and shock resistance, SSDs are well suited to meet the needs of point of care devices. However, when these and other components fail proper medical device destruction is required.</p>
<p><b>Types of Memory</b></p>
<p>There are several types of commonly used NAND flash memory: single level cell (SLC), multi-level cell (MLC), and triple level cell (TLC).  The choice of which flash to use can be difficult for system designers because of the difference in reliability and cost between the types. SLC is the most expensive and reliable followed by MLC and TLC which are the least expensive and reliable. To complicate matters, the storage durability requirements are not immediately clear during development. However, today’s SSDs are able to self-report which allows designers better select the type of flash based on requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Storage requirements for HIPAA Covered Entities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical equipment needs to remain in service for much longer than the average consumer device. Therefore, storage failures must be kept to a minimum. Because of the sensitive nature of patient information, these devices must also have increased security capabilities. Entities covered under HIPAA law must be especially aware of the capabilities of their medical devices, as data breaches or device failure could result in high fines and lawsuits. When devices do fail or are retired, these entities are required by HIPAA to have agreements in place with their service providers that ensure the proper handling of sensitive data containing devices. A good provider should be able to demonstrate past success in eliminating data from SSDs and covered entities should always choose a provider that confirms data destruction, and medical device destruction.  Even if the covered entity&#8217;s internal security has previously cleared the device data the risks are too high not to have a safe-guard built into the disposal process. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing hard drive shredding and destruction and wiping, Avritek offers medical device destruction. </span></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.avritek.com/2015/10/28/avr-recycling-is-now-avritek/"><![CDATA[<div><span style="color: #202020;">I am thrilled to announce that <span class="il">AVR</span> Recycling is now<a href="http://www.avritek.com"> </a></span><a href="http://www.avritek.com"><span class="il">Avritek</span>!</a><span style="color: #202020;"><a href="http://www.avritek.com"> </a>  As our business has evolved we wanted </span><span style="color: #000000;">to ensure</span><span style="color: #202020;"> that our brand was truly reflective of the services we provide our clients.</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>While we will continue to provide the same <a href="http://www.avritek.com/logistics-removal-recycling.html" target="_blank">electronic recycling services</a> we have always offered our clients, our services have evolved to be even more focused on ITAM (IT Asset Management) services, such as,<a href="http://www.avritek.com/data_product_destruction_and_sanitization.html" target="_blank"> IP &amp; Data Destruction</a>, <a href="http://www.avritek.com/IT-asset-value-recovery.html" target="_blank">IT Remarketing</a>, and <a href="http://www.avritek.com/logistics-removal-recycling.html" target="_blank">Reverse Logistics.</a></div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I started this business over 11 years ago out of a single car garage.  Many garages and warehouses later, the core of what we do today is no different than what I did back then &#8211; maximizing the value of excess and obsolete equipment while providing exceptional customer service.</div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I wanted to take a quick moment here to thank all of our clients (both past and present).  We truly would not be where we are today without the loyalty that so many of you have shown us.  I hope to think that our service and performance has something to do with that as well.</div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I also wanted to take the opportunity to thank one individual in particular, Stu Wood our Business Development Manager.  Stu has put in a tremendous amount of time and effort in order for us to make this transition a success.  He deserves much of the credit in bringing about this change and his contribution in this process has been invaluable.</div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Lastly, I encourage you to come join us at the <a href="http://sdcloudcomputing.com/" target="_blank">7th Annual Cloud Computing Conference this <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1107778729"><span class="aQJ">Thursday, October 29th</span></span> </a>at the Mission Valley Town and Country.  We are a sponsor of the event and will have a booth for you to come by and say hello.</div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you once again for all of your continued support,</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Microsoft is ending support for the OS on July 14, 2015, and will no longer issue security fixes after that time. Organizations who cannot upgrade will either have to purchase costly custom support from Microsoft, purchase 3rd party security tools, or migrate vulnerable servers to less exposed networks.  </span><span id="more-1330"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you’re planning a migration, you might want to explore <a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/605067-microsoft-resources-for-windows-server-2003-eol-migration">this list of Microsoft resources on Windows 2003 Server Migration</a>, and then <a href="http://www.windowsservercatalog.com/">see if your current servers are compatible</a> with newer Window’s operating systems.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you find that your servers will not support newer operating systems and you decide to upgrade your hardware, <a title="Contact" href="http://www.avritek.com/#contact"><strong>contact us.</strong></a> We actively purchase IT equipment and can provide onsite data destruction services to prevent sensitive data leaving your organization’s premises.</span></p>
