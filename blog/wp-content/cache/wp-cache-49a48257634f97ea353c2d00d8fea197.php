				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Asset Recovery and Hard Drive Shredding: A Common Need for Facilities Who are Closing Their Doors</h2>
<p>I thought that it was appropriate to start off the New Year of 2016 by going back to the beginning of 2015.  <a href="http://www.avritek.com">Avritek</a> does a lot of project-based work and the following illustrates how our expertise in IT asset disposition and hard drive shredding can help our clients during critical times likes office moves and facility closures.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in 2015 year we received a call from one of our vendor partners who worked at a large telecom company. He said that one of his clients was the VP of operations at a satellite communications company which was closing its San Diego operations, and that he had talked to him about our services. After the client expressed interest, we set up a short call to discuss the project. During the call I learned that the company had to vacate its building within two months and needed a number of our services including IT asset disposition, and data destruction / hard drive shredding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the usual IT equipment that we find in most tech companies, there was also a large amount of excess test equipment, telecom scrap, and cabling that had to be factored into the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because much of this equipment had significant value, we began the project by making a itemized inventory of this gear and providing an initial purchase quote which would be paid out after testing by our technicians. Each item was identified by make, model, and the room it was located in (server room, test lab, office etc).  </span></p>
<p>In addition to this equipment we provided a per pound payment quote on  the large amount of communications equipment scrap and cabling that was left in the facility.  Lastly, we provided our standard hard drive shredding and data destruction quotes for all of the hard drives and LTO tapes that our client required to be destroyed.</p>
<p>After the client accepted the initial quotes, we decided that a series of weekly IT asset disposition take-outs would be best for this particular project. Over the course of a month we consolidated and removed their materials, including the frequent swap-out of the large bins that we provided them to put miscellaneous equipment in. We have found that by providing these bins during the consolidation process, and by working with the client to design a process that works around their business, we are able to complete a project with minimal disruption to their operations.  When we received the equipment at our facility and tested all payable gear, we found that approximately 20% of the test equipment did not function properly. Payment for these items was amended as per our agreement with the client.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is common in these closures, mid-way through the project a few former employees began to  request if they could purchase some of the excess equipment. This can be a delicate scenario since some of these same people can actually be involved in the IT asset disposition process. However, we understand that not all requests can be made ahead of time, and we are usually happy to provide updated quotes which take these requests into account.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completed the take-out ahead of schedule, and provided the client with a check for the itemized payable equipment, and scrap value of the telecom and cable shortly thereafter. The hard drive and LTO tape shredding charges were simply deducted against this payment. At the conclusion of the project both the VP of Operations and CEO expressed how pleased they were with our team’s performance, which I always appreciate hearing.</span></p>
<p>2015 continued to be a great year. In fact, it was by far our most successful year as a company in terms of revenue and profitably, as well as continuing to learn and grow as an organization. Although we have just started 2016, this year is shaping up to be another great one and I look forward to sharing it with you through more Project File posts.</p>
